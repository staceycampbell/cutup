README for cutup release 1.0
----------------------------

Description
-----------

This is the game of cutup, a similar game was around the
amusement arcades in the mid-70s.  Two players control a
character that moves around the screen, the game stops when
either of the characters runs into something.  A match is
won when a player achieves three wins, or since simultaneous
crashes are possible, a player has at least three wins and
wins one more game than the opponent.

This version allows for two human players, or two computer
players or one computer player with one human player.  The
appropriate flags are;

	-b  two computer players, a match
	-d  two computer players continuous
	-c  a human player against a computer player

No flags specified means two human players.

An extra flag, -s, should be used if the computer heuristic
is hammering the CPU too hard, though this will make the
heuristic even less intelligent.

Porting Notes
-------------

This version of cutup was developed under XENIX 2.3 on a 386 box.
It uses named pipes and curses.  As such it will compile and run
on almost any System 5 implementation.

Edit the Makefile to ensure it is doing what you want/need.

You will have to edit usleep.c to make sure that MillisecondSleep()
is implemented in a sensible way.

System 5.[12] and System 5.3.[01] people may have to be creative here.
System 5.3.2 (or later) supports nap(), this should be used.
Basically, if you don't have nap() then try napms() (should be in
curses library), if that doesn't work then try poll().  If poll()
isn't around then have a look at SIGALRM, signal(), fork() and
kill().  If that screws up then have a look in usleep.c at the
last implementation of MillisecondSleep(), if that makes you
sick to the stomache then you are probably out of luck.

	...the usual stuff, i.e. if it trashes your system then
	tough luck.
